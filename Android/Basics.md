They play a crucial role in enabling inter-app communication and data sharing.

### Q2. What is the purpose of ProGuard in Android development?

**Answer**: ProGuard is a tool used for code shrinking, optimization, and obfuscation in Android development. It analyzes the compiled code and removes unused classes, fields, and methods, reducing the application's size. Additionally, ProGuard can obfuscate the code by renaming classes, fields, and methods, making it harder for reverse engineers to understand the code and modify it.

### Q3. What is the purpose of the Android Manifest file?
