### Q2. What are the differences between a Fragment and an Activity in Android?

**Answer**
An Activity represents a single screen in an Android application. It manages the user interface and responds to user interactions. On the other hand, a Fragment represents a portion of an Activity. Fragments allow you to build more modular and reusable components within an application. They have their lifecycle and can be added or removed dynamically within an Activity.
