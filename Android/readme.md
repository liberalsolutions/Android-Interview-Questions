1. Given a string implement a function which capitalizes first letter of every word in that string.
2. Given a list of integers return a list that contains only odd integers (only integers which are not a multiple of 2).
3. Given two ranges implement a function which checks if range1 contains range2
4. Given positive integer n implement a function which calculates sum of all numbers from 1 up to (and including) number n.
5. Given list of strings and a string return index of th value in the list or -1 if value was not found.
6. Given positive integer n implement a function which returns a list containing all steps from n to 0.
7. Given positive integer n implement a function which returns a list containing all steps up from 0 to n and down to 0.
8. Given positive Int n implement a function which returns a list of containing pairs with all combinations of numbers from 0 to n.
9. Given a sorted list of integers implement a function which counts the unique values.
10. Given positive integer n implement a function which returns a list representing all numbers from n to 1. If n value is zero then empty list should be returned.
11. Given positive integer n and integer step implement a function which returns a list representing all numbers from n to 1 taking step into consideration. If n value is zero then empty list should be returned.
12. Given positive integer base and positive integer exponent implement a function which calculates power of base of exponent.
13. Given positive integer n implement a function, which returns a factorial of that integer.
14. Given a list of integers implement a function which returns the product of all numbers in the list.
15. Given list of strings implement a recursive function which will capitalize first letter of each string in the list.
16. Given a string implement a function which returns longest word in that string. If there are two or more words that have the same length, return the first longest word from the string
17. Reverse the given list. Don't use list.reversed() method.

18. Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not. Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed. Include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome.

19. Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not. #tolerant 

20. Given a string, return true if the input string is a permutation of palindrome or false if it is not

21. Given two strings, implement a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman. Only consider characters, not spaces or punctuation. Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case.

22. Given a string implement a function which returns the character that is most commonly used in that string.
23. Given a string implement a function which returns a reversed copy of that string.
24. Given string implement a function, which returns the number of vowels used in a string. Vowels are the characters a , e i, o, u and y.

25. Given string implement a function, which returns the number of vowels used in a string. Vowels are the characters a , e i, o, u and y.

26. Given a positive integer n implement a function which returns a list representing the generatePyramid shape with n levels. The function should console log a generatePyramid shape with N levels using the # character. Make sure the generatePyramid has spaces on both the left and right hand sides.

27. Given a positive integer n implement a function which returns a list representing the generated steps with n levels using the # character. Make sure the step has appropriate number of spaces on the right hand side!

28. Given positive integer n implement a function which returns a list numbers from 1 to n. However for multiples of three list should contain word Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five list should contain word Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five list should contain FizzBuzz word.

29. Given a string and integer shift implement a function which shifts each character in that string by shift amount (cesar cipher) eg. if shift is 1 then a becomes b, c becomesd, z became a etc. Allowed input is string containing only lowercase characters from alphabet abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.

30. Given a string implement a function which returns true if string contains at least one repeated character, otherwise it returns false.

31. Implement a function that takes a list of integers and an integer count as input parameters. The purpose of the function is to find the smallest count numbers from the provided list.

32. Implement a function that takes a list of integers and an integer count as input parameters. The purpose of the function is to find the largest count numbers from the provided list.
