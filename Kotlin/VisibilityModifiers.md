### Q. What are the visibility modifiers available in Kotlin, and what do they mean?
Answer: Kotlin has four visibility modifiers:
* public: The default modifier. It makes the member visible everywhere (inside and outside the module or class).
* private: Visible only within the class or file where it is declared.
* protected: Visible within the class and its subclasses.
* internal: Visible within the same module (e.g., a library or application).
Note: If visibility modifier is not specified, it is public by default.

### Q. What is the default visibility of a class or function in Kotlin if no visibility modifier is specified?

The default visibility is public. A public class or function can be accessed from anywhere.

### Q. Can you restrict the visibility of a constructor in Kotlin? How?

Answer: Yes, you can restrict the visibility of a constructor using visibility modifiers. You can make the constructor private, protected, or internal. By making a constructor private, you prevent other classes from instantiating the class.

```Kotlin
class Person private constructor(val name: String) {
    // The primary constructor is private
}

// val person = Person("John") // This will result in a compile-time error
```

### Q. Can you declare visibility modifiers on members of an interface in Kotlin?

Answer: In Kotlin, members of an interface are always public, and you cannot change their visibility. All properties and methods declared inside an interface are implicitly public and cannot have a different visibility modifier.

```Kotlin
interface Example {
    val property: String  // Implicitly public
    fun method()  // Implicitly public
}
```

### Q. Can you restrict the visibility of componentN() functions in a data class?

Answer: No, in Kotlin, the componentN() functions generated by data classes are always public, and you cannot modify their visibility. These functions are used for destructuring declarations.

Example:
```Kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

// The componentN functions are always public:
val person = Person("John", 30)
val (name, age) = person  // Destructuring declaration
```

### Q. How does protected visibility work with sealed classes in Kotlin?
Answer: Since sealed classes are often used for class hierarchies, the protected modifier can be used to allow subclasses to access members of the sealed class. However, protected members of a sealed class cannot be accessed outside the sealed class hierarchy.
```Kotlin
sealed class Result {
    protected val status: String = "Success"
}

class Success : Result() {
    fun getStatus(): String {
        return status  // Accessible in the subclass
    }
}
```

### q. Can you apply visibility modifiers to a companion object or its members in Kotlin?
Yes, you can apply visibility modifiers to companion objects and their members. By default, companion objects are public, but you can declare them as private, protected, or internal.

```Kotlin
class MyClass {
    companion object {
        private val instance = MyClass()
    }

    fun getInstance(): MyClass {
        return instance  // Accessible within the class
    }
}
```

### Q. How does visibility work with extension functions in Kotlin?
Answer: Extension functions have the same visibility as the class they are defined in or the top-level declaration they belong to. If an extension function is declared in a file with private visibility, it can only be accessed within that file.

```Kotlin
private fun String.greet(): String {
    return "Hello, $this"
}

// The greet() function is only accessible within this file
```
### Q. How do visibility modifiers affect nested and inner classes in Kotlin?

Nested classes in Kotlin are static by default and can have any visibility modifier.
Inner classes, which maintain a reference to the outer class, can also have visibility modifiers, just like any other class.
```Kotlin
class Outer {
    private class Nested  // Only accessible within Outer
    inner class Inner  // Can access members of Outer
}
```

### Q. What is the difference between internal and public visibility modifiers in Kotlin?

### Q. Can you control the visibility of an object declaration in Kotlin?
Answer: Yes, you can control the visibility of an object declaration using visibility modifiers (public, private, protected, internal), just like with classes. This applies to both the object itself and its members.
```Kotlin
private object Singleton {
    val instance = Singleton  // Only accessible within the file
}
```
