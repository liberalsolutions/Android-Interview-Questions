### 1. What are Android Navigation Components?
Answer:
Android Navigation Component is a part of Jetpack libraries that simplifies implementing in-app navigation. It helps manage app navigation and the back stack by using a central NavController and NavHostFragment, making navigation more consistent across different screen sizes and types. It supports fragment transactions, deep linking, and even navigation through BottomNavigationView and DrawerLayout.

### 2. What are the core components of the Android Navigation Architecture Component?
Answer: The core components of Android Navigation are:

* NavGraph: A resource that defines all the navigation-related information, such as destinations, actions, and argument passing.
* NavController: A controller that manages app navigation and the back stack.
* NavHostFragment: A fragment that hosts the navigation graph and works with NavController to display the UI based on the navigation actions.
* NavDestination: Represents a destination in the app. It could be a fragment, activity, or dialog.
* NavAction: Defines transitions between destinations.
* SafeArgs: A Gradle plugin that provides type-safe argument passing between destinations.

### 3. What is NavController and how is it used?
Answer:
NavController is the central part of the Navigation Component responsible for controlling app navigation. It helps navigate between destinations (fragments or activities), handles the back stack, and coordinates deep links. It is typically retrieved from a NavHostFragment using findNavController().
```java
val navController = findNavController(R.id.nav_host_fragment)
navController.navigate(R.id.destinationFragment)
```

### 4. What is a NavGraph, and how is it defined?
Answer:
A NavGraph is an XML resource that defines the structure of navigation within the app. It specifies the appâ€™s navigation flow, destinations, and actions that link those destinations. The graph can be defined in an XML file or programmatically.
```xml
<navigation xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/nav_graph"
    app:startDestination="@id/homeFragment">
    
    <fragment
        android:id="@+id/homeFragment"
        android:name="com.example.HomeFragment"
        android:label="Home" />
    
    <fragment
        android:id="@+id/detailFragment"
        android:name="com.example.DetailFragment"
        android:label="Details" />
</navigation>
```

### 5. How do you navigate between fragments using Navigation Component?
Answer:
To navigate between fragments using Navigation Components, you typically use the NavController to trigger navigation actions. These actions are defined in the navigation graph and reference the destination fragments.
```java
val navController = findNavController()
navController.navigate(R.id.action_homeFragment_to_detailFragment)
```
Alternatively, you can define a button in your fragment that triggers the navigation.
```java
view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.navigate_button).setOnClickListener {
    findNavController().navigate(R.id.action_homeFragment_to_detailFragment)
}
```
### 6. What is the purpose of SafeArgs in Navigation Components?
Answer:
SafeArgs is a Gradle plugin for the Navigation Component that generates type-safe classes for argument passing between destinations (e.g., fragments). This reduces runtime errors and helps to pass arguments between fragments or activities in a type-safe manner.

Example:

Define an argument in the navigation graph:
```xml
<fragment
    android:id="@+id/detailFragment"
    android:name="com.example.DetailFragment">
    <argument
        android:name="userId"
        app:argType="integer" />
</fragment>
```
In the source fragment, pass the argument safely:
```java
val action = HomeFragmentDirections.actionHomeFragmentToDetailFragment(userId = 123)
findNavController().navigate(action)
```
In the destination fragment, retrieve the argument safely:
```Java
val userId = DetailFragmentArgs.fromBundle(requireArguments()).userId
```
### 7. How can you handle back navigation in Android Navigation Component?
Answer:
The NavController automatically handles the back stack for you when navigating between fragments. It adds fragments to the back stack and pops them when the user presses the back button.

If you want to navigate back programmatically, you can call:

```java
findNavController().navigateUp()
```

Or to pop a fragment off the back stack:
```java
findNavController().popBackStack()
```
You can also handle custom back button actions by overriding onBackPressed() in the Activity or using a custom OnBackPressedCallback in fragments.

### 8. How does deep linking work with Navigation Components?
Answer:
Deep linking allows an external source (like a URL) to navigate directly to a specific screen within your app. In Navigation Components, deep links can be configured in the navigation graph with <deepLink> elements.

<fragment
    android:id="@+id/detailFragment"
    android:name="com.example.DetailFragment">
    <deepLink
        app:uri="myapp://detail/{itemId}" />
</fragment>
You can also programmatically handle deep links:
```java
val deepLinkUri = Uri.parse("myapp://detail/123")
findNavController().navigate(deepLinkUri)
```

### 9. What is a NavHostFragment, and how does it differ from a regular Fragment?
Answer:
NavHostFragment is a special fragment provided by the Navigation Component that is responsible for hosting navigation destinations defined in a navigation graph. Unlike regular fragments, NavHostFragment manages navigation between fragments automatically using the NavController.
NavHostFragment serves as a container for the navigation graph and helps manage fragment transactions automatically.
