### Q1. What is Android WorkManager?

Answer: Android WorkManager is an API introduced by Google to simplify and manage background tasks in Android applications. It serves as a unified solution that abstracts away the differences between various versions of Android and their limitations regarding background processing. WorkManager enables developers to schedule and execute tasks reliably, even across device reboots.

### Q2. What are the key features of WorkManager?
WorkManager offers several essential features, including:

Support for one-time and periodic tasks.
Ability to define constraints for task execution, such as network availability or device charging status.
Guaranteed task execution, even across device reboots.
Seamless integration with other Jetpack components, such as LiveData and ViewModel.


### Q3. How can you pass data to a Worker class?

You can pass data to a Worker class by using the `setInputData()` method when creating the WorkRequest. This method allows you to attach a Data object containing `key-value` pairs. Inside the Worker's `doWork()` method, you can retrieve the data using the `getInputData()` method.

```Kotlin
Data inputData = new Data.Builder()
    .putString("key", "value")
    .build();

OneTimeWorkRequest myWorkRequest = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class)
    .setInputData(inputData)
    .build();
```

### Q4. How can you observe the progress or output of a Worker class?

WorkManager provides a LiveData object called `WorkInfo` that allows you to observe the progress and status of a Worker. By using the `getWorkInfoByIdLiveData()` method, you can obtain the `WorkInfo` object and observe it to get updates on the task's progress, output, and completion status.

```Kotlin
WorkManager.getInstance(context).getWorkInfoByIdLiveData(workRequestId)
    .observe(owner, workInfo -> {
        if (workInfo != null && workInfo.getState().isFinished()) {
            // Task finished
            // Access output data: workInfo.getOutputData()
        } else {
            // Task in progress
            // Access progress: workInfo.getProgress()
        }
    });

```
### Q5. How can you chain multiple work requests together?
To chain multiple work requests together, you can use the then() method on a WorkRequest object. This method allows you to specify another WorkRequest that should run after the current one completes. By chaining work requests, you can define a sequence of tasks and ensure they are executed in the desired order.

```Kotlin
OneTimeWorkRequest firstWorkRequest = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FirstWorker.class).build();
OneTimeWorkRequest secondWorkRequest = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(SecondWorker.class).build();

WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .beginWith(firstWorkRequest)
    .then(secondWorkRequest)
    .enqueue();
```

### Q6. How can you handle and retry failed tasks in WorkManager?
WorkManager automatically handles failed tasks by respecting the retry policy defined for the WorkRequest. You can specify the retry policy using the setBackoffCriteria() method, which allows you to define the initial and maximum delay for retries. WorkManager intelligently applies exponential backoff to retries, giving failed tasks a chance to succeed without overwhelming system resources.

```Kotlin
// Set exponential backoff with a 1-minute initial delay and a maximum of 3 retries
OneTimeWorkRequest myWorkRequest = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class)
    .setBackoffCriteria(BackoffPolicy.EXPONENTIAL, OneTimeWorkRequest.MIN_BACKOFF_MILLIS, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
    .build();
```
